## New Member and Member Kick-out Rules

- For anyone who is interested and **is already a member of the GitHub EditorConfig organization** to become a member of the board: Please add yourself into the member list -- you are automatically approved for the membership.

- For anyone who isn't a member of the GitHub EditorConfig organization, please submit a new issue to apply for the membership and explain what makes you qualified. Normally this case should be rare. Over half of the current board members must approve for the applicant to become a member.

- For board members who haven't participated in 4 consecutive votings, a notification will be sent out to asking whether retaining the membership or not. If not responded in two weeks, the membership is canceled automatically. But it is always possible to re-enter. The reason we want to kick out people (even if they can be automatically approved for membership again) is that sometimes we need over-half of the members' approving.

## Obligations

- Be able to respond to new format improvements within two weeks, at least for most of the time.
- Be able to respond to new member applications whthin two weeks, at least for most of the time.
