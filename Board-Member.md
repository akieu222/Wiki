## New Member and Member Kick-out Rules

- For anyone who is interested and **is already a member of the GitHub EditorConfig organization on or before Nov 16, 2016** to become a member of the board: Please add yourself into the member list -- you are automatically approved for the membership.

- For anyone who isn't a member of the GitHub EditorConfig organization on or before Nov 16, 2016, please submit a new issue to apply for the membership and explain what makes you qualified. Over half of the current board members must approve for the applicant to become a member.

- For board members who haven't participated in 4 consecutive votings, a notification will be sent out to asking whether retaining the membership or not. If not responded in two weeks, the membership is canceled automatically. But it is always possible to become a member again. The reason we want to kick out people (even if they can be automatically approved for membership again) is that we always need over-half of the members' approving.

## Obligations

- New format changes will require over half of the members to approve. Members should be able to respond (at least a yes or no) to it within two weeks, at least for most of the time.
- New membership application from outside the EditorConfig organization will require over half of the members to approve. Members should be able to respond (at least a yes or no) to it within two weeks, at least for most of the time.
