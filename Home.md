The wiki is in no way up to date with the [current specification](https://editorconfig-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Like the issues here, it does however contain interesting discussions about EditorConfig's past and future.

The specification defines a fairly liberal and future-proof behavior: anything not understood by the parser is ignored silently. As a result you may implement some of the extensions mentioned here, or share some of your own so people can agree on what some of the new things should do.
